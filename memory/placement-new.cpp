// Advantages of placement new operator over new operator
//
// The address of memory allocation is known before hand.
// Useful when building a memory pool, a garbage collector or simply when performance and exception safety are paramount.
// Thereâ€™s no danger of allocation failure since the memory has already been allocated, and constructing an object on a pre-allocated buffer takes less time.
// This feature becomes useful while working in an environment with limited resources.

// What will be the output of this code, and what should be done to correct it?
